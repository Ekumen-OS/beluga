/**
 * \page SensorModelPage Beluga named requirements: SensorModel
 * Requirements for a sensor model to be used in a Beluga `ParticleFilter`.
 *
 * \section SensorModelRequirements Requirements
 * A type `T` satisfies the `SensorModel` requirements if the following is satisfied:
 * - `T::state_type` is a valid type, representing a particle state.
 * - `T::weight_type` is an arithmetic type, representing a particle weight.
 * - `T::measurement_type` is a valid type, representing a sensor measurement.
 *
 * Given:
 * - An instance `p` of `T`.
 * - A possibly const instance `cp` of `T`.
 * - A possibly const instance `m` of `T::measurement_type`.
 * - A possibly const instance `s` of `T::state_type`.
 *
 * Then:
 * - `p.update_sensor(m)` will update the sensor model with `p`.
 *   This will not actually update the particle weights, but the update done here
 *   will be used in the following `importance_weight()` method calls.
 * - `cp.importance_weight(s)` returns a `T::weight_type` instance representing the weight of the particle.
 * - `cp.make_random_state()` returns a `T::state_type` instance.
 *
