# Make builds more reproducible by using a static value for PATH and not inheriting LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
# Use `--action_env=ENV_VARIABLE` if you want to inherit specific variables from the environment where Bazel runs.
# Note that doing so can prevent cross-user caching if a shared cache is used.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2574 for more details.

# Reuse sandbox directories between invocations.
# Directories used by sandboxed non-worker execution may be reused to avoid unnecessary setup costs.

# On CI, announce all announces command options read from the bazelrc file(s) when starting up at the
# beginning of each Bazel invocation. This is very useful on CI to be able to inspect which flags

# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6627
# This may break local workflows that `build` a binary target, then run the resulting program outside of `bazel run`.
# In those cases, the script will need to call `bazel build --build_runfile_links //my/binary:target` and then execute the resulting program.

# On CI, add a timestamp to each message generated by Bazel specifying the time at which the message was displayed.
