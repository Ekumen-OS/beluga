Beluga AMCL is a ROS 2 package that builds on Beluga to provide 2D AMCL for mobile robots.
It is interface and feature wise compatible with its longstanding counterpart in the ROS ecosystem: the
[`nav2_amcl`](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/main/nav2_amcl) package. This affords a simple migration path for `nav2_amcl`-based projects that want to leverage Beluga instead.
