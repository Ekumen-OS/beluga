Beluga AMCL is a ROS and ROS 2 package that builds on Beluga to provide 2D AMCL for mobile robots.
It is interface and feature wise compatible with both of its longstanding  counterparts in the ROS ecosystem: [`amcl`](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/tree/noetic-devel/amcl) and
[`nav2_amcl`](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/main/nav2_amcl) packages. This affords a simple migration path for `nav2_amcl`-based (or `amcl`-based) projects that want to leverage Beluga instead.
